Design notes
============

Currently I have a great framework for building up the hierarchical data framework, but it's a bit spaghetti-ish and data-specific. Meanwhile, I have a similar kind of 'framework' problem to solve for the Trouw app. Can I generalize?

My goal, however, is to get maps as soon as possible, so that I can start styling stuff. But this is an important problem to solve first, because I have the feeling we're going to be needing lots of flexibility for handling two-way data-binding later on.
