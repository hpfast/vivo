making feature collections


question 1: do we give the script both a single route and a multiroute mode?




def createRouteLegs():
    """
    create single lineStrings between two points
    """

#execute if in multi-mode    
def joinLegsIntoRouteGeoms():
    """
    join individual legs into a linestring representing a whole route
    """
    


#output is a featureCollection: the print function doesn't care.
